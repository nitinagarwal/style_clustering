# Style Clustering

A 3D mesh can be represented by Images, Points, Voxels or Mesh. In this code we are trying to compare between
these representations and analyze the tradeoffs between them. We can compare them on various tasks.

Tasks:
1. Capturing details:\ 
Question: Which representation would be best for capturing details?\
Dataset Used: [Co-Locating Style-Defining Elements on 3D Shapes](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3092817#)


## Getting Started
This implementation uses Pytorch.

Code has been tested on Pytorch 0.3.1 and Python 2.7.14
